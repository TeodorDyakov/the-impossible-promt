        <h1>The Impossible Prompt That's Easy for Humans</h1>

        <p>Historically there have been very simple prompts that LLMs struggled with disproportionately
            compared to the areas in which they excel. The early versions of ChatGPT struggled with very simple
            one-step logical deduction. But that is no longer the case; in the last 2.5 years, LLMs have progressed
            tremendously.</p>

        <p>In fact, in 2025, with most LLMs achieving superior results in so many tasks, it is hard to find a prompt with a simple, objective answer that is trivially verifiable,
            in which LLMs fail a 100%, but most humans can produce a correct answer.</p>
        <p>Yet they still do exists and here I want to present one such prompt. So without further ado here is the prompt i used:</p>
        <div id="prompt">
            <code>Create an image that displays two seven-pointed stars, two eight-pointed stars, and two nine-pointed stars. All stars are connected to each other, except for the ones with the same number of strands. The lines connecting the stars must NOT intersect.</code>
        </div>
        <p>
            It's actually a fun little problem. Using a pen and an
            old notebook (tool use, am I right🙂), it took me (a person of very average intelligence) about a minute of
            scribbling to arrive at a solution. Give it a try!</p>
        <p>Here are the results from all the major models:</p>



        <p>We start with <strong>ChatGPT</strong>:</p>
        <img src="ChatGPT.png" class="responsive">
        <p>Uh oh... Did it get anything right at all 🙃</p>
        <p><strong>Grok</strong> gave us two images, how kind!</p>
        <img src="grok.png" class="responsive">
        <p>At least it looks pretty.</p>
        <p>We continue with <strong>Gemini</strong>... </p>
        <img src="gemini.jpg" class="responsive">
        <p>And the most promising one, the rockstar of image generation, <strong>Nano Banana Pro</strong>.</p>
        <img src="nano_banana.png" class="responsive">
        <p>Looks promising but still wrong.</p>

        <h2>Why is this query so hard for LLMs?</h2>

        <p>My theory:</p>

        <p>This query combines two things that have historically been the hardest for LLMs to handle: counting
            (amusingly) and spatial awareness. These are further combined with a niche fact from graph theory, so it
            isn't even obvious that the query is solvable.</p>
